.PA
I am a computer scientist and software engineer with extensive
experience in both applied research and industrial-strength software
development.
My interests in software span the range from high-level languages
and specifications all the way down to assembly code and
hardware interaction.
To date I have worked on several flight-related research
projects at JPL.
I seek additional experience in designing and building 
flight software systems.

I perform research and development relating to space flight 
software systems. 
My recent projects include 
(1) designing and prototyping a programming language that simplifies 
the development and verification of flight software;
(2) developing a rule-based testing framework for flight software;
(3) developing benchmarks for evaluating a next-generation 
multicore space flight processor; and
(4) reverse-engineering a motor controller written
in 8051 assembly.
On my own time and initiative I developed NiceC, an improved
version of the C programming language, which I have used in
several of my JPL projects.

.PH "Postdoctoral Associate"
Working with Professor Jonathan Aldrich, I developed novel 
combinations of type systems and logical reasoning for checking 
that high-level parallel programming abstractions are correctly 
implemented and used.
My postdoc was supported in part by a Computing Innovation 
Fellowship grant from the Computing Community Consortium.

.PH "Ph.D. Student and Graduate Research Assistant"
For my Ph.D. thesis work, I designed, implemented, 
and evaluated an extension of the Java programming language
called Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ).
DPJ uses program annotations called \fIeffects\fR to ensure 
that parallelizing a sequential program does not 
change the program's output, unless the programmer uses explicit 
and controlled forms of nondeterminism. 
My thesis won the 2010 ACM SIGPLAN John C. Reynolds Dissertation 
Award and UIUC's 2012 David J. Kuck Outstanding Thesis Award.

I also designed and implemented the first 
software transactional memory (STM) for large-scale 
\*Qshared nothing\*U clusters. 
Previous STM research had focused on small-scale, 
cache-coherent shared memory machines; 
my design showed good scalability for several HPC benchmarks
on a 512-core machine.
